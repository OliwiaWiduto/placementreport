  # Design  

  Seeing as I was working directly as a developer, I didn’t get much chance to practice my design skills, however I did pick up a lot working with the designers. I am forever in awe of Jay’s super slick outside-the-box takes on Moodle and Ryan’s modern minimalistic branding.  

  I decided I really missed illustration and design, so I embarked on a couple projects/commissions of my own. Downloading Procreate was a massive game changer for me - I drew drew drew and posted my work, until one of my favourite local bands contacted me to design some t-shirts. I worked alongside Villa in France to create a 3 color vector image, drawn in procreate and rasterized in AI. It was one of the most surreal feelings to see people kicking about town in these.

I went from 0 to 100 in terms of using terminal. When I came in, I had no idea about using git from terminal, nevermind ssh, vi, vim, nano, cat, deploying, sudo and all the other functions I’ve now forgotten how to do in Finder. 
 
I’m sure Michael Slevin has cried himself to sleep about how many times he had to fix git issues for me, but as soon as I discovered cheat sheets, I was flying.
