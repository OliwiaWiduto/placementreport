  So you can see, both my skills and qualities didn’t map perfectly on top of those needed for my role.  

  My saving grace was that I’d been doing commissions for years, so client comms came naturally to me. This gave me the leeway to figure out, and transform myself into all the things I wasn’t.

Working as a **Support Technician** has been one of the biggest challenges of my life to date.  

Growth is **uncomfortable and painful**, and there have been few times when I revelled in those feelings as acutely as I have over the past 11 months. 
 
In terms of skills, I joined Synergy Learning as a **UX Designer** with a background in digital art and some very basic **CSS & HTML** knowledge. Moodle is built on PHP, handlebars and SCSS.  

As far as personal qualities go, I am a creative problem solver in the sense of design (i.e. creating branding, user flows) but never ever, have I been a round-the-clock **technical problem solver**.
