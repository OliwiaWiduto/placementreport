Our knowledge base is built on **Confluence**, internally named **‘Aloha’** after Roy’s trip to Hawaii. This is another powerful tool, it’s main feature being an extraordinarily **customisable WYSIWYG** with blocks containing complex elements (a little like bootstrap elements, but many also containing backend functionality) which can be styled further with css. 
 
I wrote a lot of **basic documentation** such as setting up a Moodle playground on your local machine, but one of my favourite projects was building the **team directory** which I built out to look like a book. While working on this, I discovered a **pain point in Aloha**.
