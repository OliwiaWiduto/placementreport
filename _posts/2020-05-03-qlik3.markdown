In the 8 months since this project, I thought about better ways for the client to convey this information but the biggest lesson here was that *static sites just don’t do the job in a world which moves as fast as ours*.  

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed getting to know the capabilities of bootstrap, and working with the client. I also received endless help from my team - shoutout to Kenny for one of the most reassuring pats on the back I’ve ever received!
