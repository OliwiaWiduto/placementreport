  In its simplest form, an LMS is a complex web application transforming education by bringing it to your computer and mobile devices.
  <br><br>
  At Synergy Learning we build upon 2 open source applications, Moodle and Totara. We specialise in creating themes, additional functionality, developing blocks and plugins.  
  Our core values are 1team, compassion, wow, fun and innovation.

The name ‘Moodle’ stands for *Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment*. This means that the application is built up of various moving parts - most prominently, **blocks** and **plugins**.  

Following on from the education model, there is a user facing backend where teachers (referred to in the application as; admin, editing manager, teacher) can upload resources for students (student, learner) to view and complete.  

Aptly described by my co-worker Chris Young, Totara is simply “Moodle on steroids”.  

LMS is an abbreviation of ‘*Learning Management System*’ - a twist on the more widely known Content Management System.
