The role of **UX Developer** refers to building and styling themes and additional functionality. The core skills required are not dissimilar to **frontend development**, with a sprinkle of **PHP**.
  
  The **backend** functionality of both Moodle and Totara is written with **PHP and Javascript**, and the **frontend**, in our case, is developed with **handlebars and SCSS**.  

As a UX Developer Intern, I mostly worked on **application and theme support**. This meant I was responsible for helping clients find their way around the application, making small **theme changes** to **enhance accessibility** and fit brand guidelines, as well as fixing **bugs**.
