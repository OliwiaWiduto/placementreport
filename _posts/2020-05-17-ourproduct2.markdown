LMS is an abbreviation of ‘Learning Management System’ - a twist on the more widely known Content Management System. In its simplest form, an LMS is a complex web application transforming education by bringing it to your computer and mobile devices.
 
At Synergy Learning we build upon 2 open source applications, Moodle and Totara. We specialise in creating themes, additional functionality, developing blocks and plugins. 
 
Our core values are 1team, compassion, wow, fun and innovation.
