Managing my time this year has been a big hurdle. Rather than finding this so called work-life balance, I felt like I was walking a tightrope juggling work, family, friends, a side hustle, exercise, chronic pain and preparing for my final year of university.
 
I donâ€™t think I did too bad.
 
I learned that the key is to set goals with good reason so that you can persevere despite obstacles. Next, create a healthy routine based on these. I had never before kept timesheets as thorough as those which we maintain at Synergy Learning, and I have found this to be incredibly beneficial in helping me identify my strengths and weaknesses. Massive shoutout to [Timing App](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) for being a great help!
