Here’s something I learned about myself: I’m a collaborative worker.  

I noticed while accidentally simultaneously working with Nathan on a Support ticket, that I work much better in partner programming situations with the ability to bounce ideas and just a little bit of competition. I’ve always been a strong communicator and it seems my troubleshooting abilities soar when I say my hunches out loud. That’s just a little fun fact.  

Similarly, I love love love speaking to clients and selling products. I always received 4 and 5 star reviews even from the most difficult clients, and believe me, that wasn’t for my off the cuff knowledge of Moodle config.
