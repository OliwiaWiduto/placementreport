Feeling confident and inspired, I had a couple ideas for my final year project which would all require me to build an app. I had a little play about with xcode and noticed some of the skills I needed are those which I didnâ€™t take full advantage of learning at Synergy Learning - namely, programming and databases.
 
I got on the good sides of the people who worked with the above, and got to shadow some of the amazing things they do. A big thank you is in order to Alex Paphitis who showed me lots of database basics - the hardest part is always starting out so I was incredibly lucky to have someone on that journey with me!
