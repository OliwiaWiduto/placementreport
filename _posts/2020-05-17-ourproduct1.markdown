The name ‘Moodle’ stands for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment. This means that the application is built up of various moving parts - most prominently, blocks and plugins. Following on from the education model, there is a user facing backend where teachers (referred to in the application as; admin, editing manager, teacher) can upload resources for students (student, learner) to view and complete. Aptly described by my co-worker Chris Young, Totara is simply “Moodle on steroids”.
